## Who Am I:
By day I lead Software Development teams with a specialty in ML. By night I ride bikes, climb rocks, ski mountains or train to get the most out of life. You can generally find me outside on a random adventure anytime possible.

## My Journey:
Born in Canberra, Australia, I studied Engineering in Software at the University of Canberra, specialising in Biometric authentication and AI. My honours thesis involved developing a real-time pathfinding system in a dynamic environment on PS2 Hardware.

After what was to be the first of many Canadian holidays I returned to Canberra to work with an amazing team at CEA Technologies developing  radar control systems. I worked alongside analysts and electronic engineers to produce a full threat detection  system. The problems we dealt with were incredibly complex and we were  working directly on the hardware (low-level)

I enjoyed my work but my heart was always in Canada and after many trips back I moved permanently to Canada in 2012 living in Revelstoke BC, skiing a lot, and taking a new direction with my career working for a not-for-profit in public Avalanche safety. Here the problems were complex due to the limited resources available, but together we changed the landscape of public Avalanche safety in Canada. Building a new way of visualizing avalanche safety information and building a crowd-sourcing network to obtain data from information blindspots.

I took a brief hiatus to work as a tech lead at Amazon building a data metadata and discovery system on top of their big data infrastructure and working with data scientists in fraud, before returning to Avalanche Canada to work directly with a research team and avalanche forecasters to build new forecasting data and reporting tools. This was until covid changed the world and funding disappeared, so I took another pivot to  work for tech startups. First a data passport tool and then Scribd the world's largest online library where I led a team building the Machine Learning Platform first as a staff engineer and then in a management role. Scribd's machine learning team was growing exponentially and the introduction of LLM's sped this up even further.

## Working with me and my communication style:
I have worked in a variety of industries but I think working in the Avalanche Industry (both along side forecasters and as a tail guide) has probably taught me the most about communication.

In this environment   
- It is very important to leave your ego at the door and create a space where everyone feels comfortable discussing their observations and thoughts. It is important that even if you are not the leader you are willing to disagree or bring new thoughts to the table thus avoiding [groupthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink)
- Quick information is vital, and not all information needs to be  polished. I work on the "Principle of least surprise" the idea being you want to be surprised as little as possible by having the pertinent information. When in the backcountry we are always talking about what we see even if we think the other person has seen this, this ensures nothing goes missed. [The only valid measurement of code quality](https://www.osnews.com/story/19266/wtfsm/)
- You make a plan based on a hypothesis of current conditionas, but  you must always be willing to take in new information and reasses as this information becomes available.
   
Through this I have developed a communication style where I have a preference for:
- Candid respectful communication, even when it is uncomfortable. ["Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood"](https://www.franklincovey.com/the-7-habits/habit-5/)
- Providing information quickly, this means in person communication is not always an option and there is not always time to polish this information fully. This might look like dropping a message in slack with a follow up document later on, rather than writing the document first. This also means my door is always open and I never mind being interupted. 
- Avoiding analysis paralayis and making a plan with current information knowing that it may not be perfect and being willing to revisit or pivot if new information becomes available. This also requires decisions to be explicit, attempting to avoid assumptions and being explicit about how much we do and don't know.
